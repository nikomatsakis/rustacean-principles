# Rustacean Principles

This is an experimental repository working towards a set of principles for Rust. These principles are focused on the design of Rust as well as what kinds of skills people need to participate successfully in the Rust community. The goal is ultimately to let us *move faster* without losing coherence: clearly articulated principles allow us to enable and empower more people to act independently. They also both guide designs proactively and let us identify and talk about problems in designs and behavior with more precision.

## Frequently asked questions

### Are these principles "official"?

No. These represent nikomatsakis's point-of-view, and the point-of-view of those folks who have contributed to them.

### Should they be? Why not make an RFC?

Maybe! That's not clear yet. For now, the focus is on evolving the principles and experimenting with how they can be put to use.
